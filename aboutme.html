 <h3>&rsaquo; About Me</h3>
 <p>	I was 12 years old when I had read Turing's original 1948 paper 'Intelligent Machines,' discussing self-conscious machines. The child in me was deeply intrigued by the question of Consciousness; I read extensively on the subject and self-taught myself programming with LISP and Python. 
At 14, I explored Herbert Simon's decision-making models, early cognitive models like the CHREST and EPAM, computer-modelling and the mind-body problem as hobby. In high school, I developed an interest in neuroscience and evolution. I decided to graduate in Physics after being introduced to neuroscience. I chose Physics at the University of Hyderabad, a top institution, with a fully funded INSPIRE Scholarship by the government awarded to the top 1% of students in India pursuing research.

Thanks to the 8 years of experience I gathered with programming and computers, I used the time at university to expose myself to a variety of disciplines. At IIT Hyderabad, I did a long project in computational biology, then moved on to a defence research lab at Advanced Center for Research in High Energy Materials(ACHREM) on a physics project to detect explosives with radars.
	 
	 When I am not coding, I am either sleeping or dreaming, or both. I also like to do electronics and build cool physics experiments in my free time.
