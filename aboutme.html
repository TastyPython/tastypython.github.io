 <h3>&rsaquo; About Me</h3>
 <p>	I was 12 years old when I had read Turing's original 1948 paper 'Intelligent Machines,' discussing self-conscious machines. The child in me was deeply intrigued by the question of Consciousness; I read extensively on the subject and self-taught myself programming with LISP and Python. 
At 14, I explored Herbert Simon's decision-making models, early cognitive models like the CHREST and EPAM, computer-modelling and the mind-body problem as hobby. In high school, I developed an interest in neuroscience and evolution. I decided to graduate in Physics after being introduced to neuroscience. I chose Physics at the University of Hyderabad, a top institution, with a fully funded INSPIRE Scholarship by the government awarded to the top 1% of students in India pursuing research.

Thanks to the 8 years of experience I gathered with programming and computers, I used the time at university to expose myself to a variety of disciplines. At IIT Hyderabad, I did a long project in computational biology, then moved on to a defence research lab at Advanced Center for Research in High Energy Materials(ACHREM) on a physics project to detect explosives with radars. Later I got an opportunity to work in a startup to make a AI system for assessing freshness in food without human contact, potentially like the handheld scanners we use to detect temperature and we filed a patent for this work. I also discovered a simple physics-based solution to an insect pest at the university called the 'Acid Fly', which was resistant to pesticide spraying, and cause deadly acid burns on skin if exposed. The solution was quite simple, change of lights in rooms to LEDs would solve the problem. I published the discovery with evidence in 2024 in an entomology journal since the insect is a well-known global pest, and it gained wide popularity by all major newspapers in India, which dubbed me "the student from Hyderabad who solved the acid fly menace". Today, the pest is no longer a threat, reinforcing my commitment to using science for societal impact.

These detours have not deterred me from my childhood dream of understanding human Consciousness. My early work with cognitive models revealed to me the limitations of backpropagation in neural networks—it is slow, energy-intensive, and ill-suited for simulating complex decision-making.. So, over the past three years, I’ve been trying to develop a biologically inspired learning mechanism for artificial neural networks inspired by dendritic ‘spines’ in real neurons, which adapt dynamically during learning through expansion and contraction. This approach blends biology and computer science to enable neural networks to train efficiently with minimal data, just like how humans do. Early results show promise, and if successful,I believe it will pave the way for massively parallel neuromorphic computing paradigms that are highly efficient, imagine a LLM that works on a neuromorphic chip the size of a small coin ! That would enable us to take up bigger questions like the mind and massively complex intelligence, or things like emotion. Once this project is complete, I plan to explore the neuronal basis of language, information processing, and the biological roots of emotion, choosing a model organism that balances complexity and abstraction. My research focuses on mimicking core principles from biology and put them to use for computer science. 
	 When I am not coding, I am either sleeping or dreaming, or both. I also like to do electronics and build cool physics experiments in my free time.
